<u>Population:</u><br> 
Displays the current number of rats present in the format "rats present / maximum number of rats that can be present."<br>
The line below displays the rate per second at which the current rat population increases. Your rate starts off at 1 and can<br>
be increased by buying groups with rats under the recruitment section. Your maximum population is displayed under that, which<br>
can be increased by purchasing expansions. The check population button refreshes the page to show the current population,<br>
though all buttons refresh the population as well.<br><br>
<u>Recruitment:</u><br>
You can purchase groups to increase the rate at which your population increases. The amount of times you purchased each<br>
group is shown, along with the price to purchase the next group and the effect that each group has on the rate of<br>
population increase. The price for all buildings increases by 1.3 times for each purchase. The rate of each group<br>
doubles every 2 expansions. Groups are hidden until you purchase one of the previous group. To purchase a group, press<br>
the button with the group name on it. If you do not have enough score to purchase a group, then an error message will be<br>
shown in the situation section. <br><br>
<u>Expansion:</u><br> 
The expand colony button purchases an expansion for the colony. An expansion increases the maximum population of rats <br>
and advances the story. In addition, all rate increases for all building will double every 2 expansions, which is tracked<br>
in the text below the expansion button. <br><br>
<u>Situation:</u><br> 
Provides context/a plot for the events and the units and naming used in the game. In the story, the population of rats<br>
is the amount of rats you have under your command. When you form a rat group under recruitment, you take rats away from<br>
your free, unemployed population and give them a job, which is to recruit other rats for you, increasing your rate of<br>
population increase. When you expand your colony, you take rats away from your free, unemployed population and give them<br>
the duty of journeying out to new lands to create homes and infrastructure for your population. As you progress through<br>
the story, your rats become more domesticated and stronger from the food that you've been feeding them, which causes<br>
group rates to double because each individual rat has more physical capabilities as the story progresses.<br><br>
<u>Encryption:</u><br> 
In the url and in the HTML of the page, the gamedata (e.g. timestamp, one, score) is encrypted. It is encrypted<br>
based off of a series of instructions provided by a randomly generated key, which is stored in the query string.<br>
When a page is generated, the key is used to decrypt the encrypted gamedata, which is then stored. The stored<br>
gamedata has math performed on it for things like score increases and purchases. When all the math is done and<br>
new gamedata is generated, a new random key is generated and the gamedata is encrypted using the new random key<br>
and put in the HTML. If you try to change the gamedata, the page might break, or numbers might change unexpectedly.<br>
If this happens, you can go back to your last page and continue from there.<br><br>
<u>Titles:</u><br> 
The titles of the page change with each refresh (each button press). We included some references and flavor text<br>
relating to rats, games, and about this game.<br><br>
<u>Initialization</u><br> 
At the beginning of the game, when you are at a url like https://lisa.stuy.edu/~eshieh10/fp/rats.py, then the game<br>
needs to be initialized. Initialization creates the starting variables needed for the game to work and sets them to<br>
the default state. If one of the variables is missing, the game will not function.<br><br>
<u>Running Time</u><br> 
Althrough the page only updates/runs when you press one of the buttons (refresh it), the game progresses in the<br>
background, even if the browser isn't open. This happens because the game calculates score increase by finding<br>
the difference between the last refresh and the current time. If you leave the game overnight, provided that your<br>
browser has its "pick up where you left off" option enabled or you saved the url, then the score will increase<br>
by the time since you last checked it.<br><br>
<u>Saves:</u><br> 
You can save your game by saving the current url of the game. You can also share this url with friends and they<br>
will start where you left off. If you save the url and then load it after a while, then the score will increase<br>
by the amount of time you left it (see Running Time).<br><br>
